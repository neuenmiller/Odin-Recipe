    <h1>Spicy Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai)</h1>
    <p>My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil. 
        The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. 
        The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.</p>

    <h2>What Is Thai Basil Chicken?</h2>
    <p>Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, 
        garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. 
        It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sauce</strong>
        <p>Chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, 
        and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe. </p></li>
        
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>
        <p>Chef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. 
        You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture. </p></li>
        
        <li><strong>Shallots and garlic</strong>
        <p>Sliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor. </p></li>
        
        <li><strong>Hot chile peppers</strong>
        <p>This is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat. </p></li>

        <li><strong>Basil</strong>
        <p>This recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or "holy" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish.
        "No, I didn't use the real "holy" basil," says Chef John. "But even with regular basil, this simple recipe is spectacular. Aromatic basil is the perfect herb for pairing with the slightly sweet, sort of salty, and possibly spicy, chopped meat." </p></li>
